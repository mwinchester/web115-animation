    <h2>Why use CSS for animation?</h2>
    <p>The first animations on the web were Animated Gifs. They allowed
    animation by having multiple images change on the screen, creating an
    animation in the style of an old flip book. These still work, and you 
    will see them on the web.</p>
    <p>The next major player in web animation was Macromedia (later Adobe) Flash.
    Flash used scalable vector graphics to produce animations. At one time 
    98% of web accessible devices worked with Flash.</p>
    <p>Then the mobile revolution happened, and mobile devices quit supporting
    Flash. A better way to animate, that would work with web standards, needed 
    to develop.</p>
    <p>Now you can create simple animations with CSS3. For more advanced
    animation techniques, you will need to learn JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>Animating a Div to move</h2>
    <p>The heart image is inside the div, so by moving the div, we animate the heart. The div has 
    an id="heart" so that we can specify exactly what we want to animate.</p>

    <div id="heart"><img src="heart.png" alt="cartoon heart"></div>
    <p>The code looks like this:</p>
    <div class="mycode">
    <code>
        #heart{ <br>
        width: 300px;<br>
        height: 300px;<br>
        position: relative;<br>
        left:200px;<br>
        -webkit-animation-name: heart-move; /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */<br>
        -webkit-animation-duration: 4s; /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */<br>
        animation-name: heart-move;<br>
        animation-duration: 6s;<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        @keyframes heart-move {<br>
        0%   {left:200px; top:0px;}<br>
        25%  {left:500px; top:0px;}<br>
        50%  {left:500px; top:200px;}<br>
        75%  {left:200px; top:200px;}<br>
        100% {left:200px; top:0px;}<br>
        }<br>

    </code></div>
        <p>You can also change how many times the animation will loop, delay start, colors, etc. Please
        check out the W3schools site for a full reference.</p>
